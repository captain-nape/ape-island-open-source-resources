# ape-island-open-source-resources

Welcome to Captain Nape’s open-source GitHub Repo! The core team has discontinued development of ApeIn and The Isles of Motu, but we’re pleased to announce that we’ve open-sourced everything the community needs to continue the story however they see fit. Thanks to the magic and immutable nature of NFTs, the journey is just beginning. Good luck, God speed, and may the winds be ever in your favor!
